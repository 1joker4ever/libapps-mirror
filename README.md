# Hello

This repository holds web applications that make use of libdot/.

libdot/ is a small set of JS libraries initially developed as part of hterm,
now available as shared code.

hterm/ is a JS based terminal emulator that is reasonably fast, reasonably
correct, and reasonably portable across browsers.

nassh/ is a Chrome App (currently a "v1.5" app, soon to become a "v2" or
Platform App) that combines hterm with a NaCl build of OpenSSH to provide
a PuTTY-like app for Chrome users.

See HACK.md for information about how to get a local copy of the source and
submit patches.
